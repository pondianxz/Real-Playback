<p align="center">Record your experience without having to leave the world.</p>

Real Playback is a Minecraft Datapack that i made back in 2023, where you can record and replay your experience (kinda like ReplayMod or Flashback), except you don't have to leave the world to view your footage.

### ðŸ›  For versions: 1.17 to 1.19

It has a lot a different customizations and settings you can use, to make your footage **the way you want it to be.** Some of them include:
- Change position/rotation speed
- Change interpolation of keyframes (Linear or Bezier)
- View path duration
- Save/Load paths
- Import/Export paths to another world
- _and much more..._

## âš  Coming soon in Portuguese (Brazil), as well as more languages
