# ðŸ“· Real Playback
**Craft Your moment. In Real Time.** Record your experience without having to leave the world.


Real Playback is a Minecraft Datapack for version 1.17 to 1.19, where you can record and replay your experience (kinda like ReplayMod or Flashback), except you don't have to leave the world to view your footage.

And still, it has a lot a different customizations and settings you can use, to make your footage **the way you want it to be.** Some of them include:
- Change position/rotation speed
- Change interpolation of keyframes (Linear or Bezier)
- View path duration
- Save/Load paths
- Import/Export paths to another world
- _and much more..._
